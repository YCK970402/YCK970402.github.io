I'm a second year master's student in the Graduate Institute of [Linguistics](https://linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html), supervised by [Prof.Chia-Lin Charlene Lee](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=58CFn84AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW&oi=ao). I'm broadly interested in psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, specifically in referential resolution, lexical/referential ambiguity and the role of working memory in language processing.

I am a member of [Brain & Language Processing lab](http://blplab.linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/), where I learn how to conduct EEG/ERP experiments and assist in neurolinguistics research. My current projects include 1) using statistical learning paradigm to investigate the role of right hemispheric responses in syntactic processing, and 2) Increasing the difficulty in referential resolution to investigate the underlying mechanism of Nref effect (an ERP component elicited by referentially ambiguous expressions)
